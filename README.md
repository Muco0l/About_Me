👋 Hey, I'm Mukul — a Generative AI Engineer building real-time, agentic AI systems that *think*, *stream*, and *scale*.

🔍 I work at the intersection of LLMs, LangChain, and voice/video tech — crafting autonomous agents that power mock interviews, recruitment workflows, and AI tutors.

🛠️ Favorite tools: Python · LangChain · GPT-4o · Gemini · Llama-2 · Ollama · Streamlit · WebRTC · LiveKit · Vector DBs · RAG

🚀 Highlights:
- Built a **multi-agent interview simulator** with real-time GPT-4o & Gemini 2.0
- Automated **recruitment pipelines** using Llama-2 + LangChain Agents
- Optimized LLM prompts to reduce hallucinations by 25% and boost relevance
- Love shipping AI that helps people learn, grow, and get hired

📌 Currently exploring:
- Real-time AI tutors with multimodal context
- Tiny LLMs on-device for private inference
- Evaluation frameworks for GenAI UX
